Agriculture is the most important contributor to the environmental changes and as the worldâ€™s population has increased, the demand for food, energy and water has increased. In this notebook, we will look at the environmental effects of several food items. The data set can be found here.

In the first section of the notbook environmental impacts of production of common food items are presented. Four metrics are considered to make comparison between food items. These metrics are:

greenhouse gas emissions (kgs of CO2-equivalents): Greenhouse gases are mainly carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane, which are present as CO2 equivalent

Land use (m2)

freshwater withdrawals (liters)

eutrophying emissions (grams of PO4-equivalents): Eutrophying emissions represent runoff of excess nutrients into the surrounding environment and waterways, which pollute ecosystems.

Furthermore, we will also look closer to food supply chain, which consists of land usage, farm, animal feed, processing transport and retail and packaging to find out the most influentioal contributor to environmental contamination.

In the second section effects of our diet on environment is studied. 3 diets are compared: Regualr, Vegan and Vegie. For each diet, 3 meal plans are created and their environmental impacts are compared.
